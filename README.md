Hello and welcome to the movies App!
This app was developed with expo.

First install all required dependencies by typing "yarn install" in the command line.

To start,type "yarn start" in the command line.

To run it on IOS, scan the QR code with an iphone or open Ios simulator.

To run with android, connect an android device and press "run on android device/emulator".

Thanks,
Amit Sova
